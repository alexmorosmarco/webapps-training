/**
 * TODO: Exercise 2.2: improve the styles of the app:
 *   1. Avoid the header from scrolling. For getting that, give all possible
 *      vertical height/weigth to the "main" tag using flex on its parent.
 *   2. Apply an horizontal flex layout for the header items, in a way that
 *      the title is centered and the other things at both sides limits.
 *   3. Improve the article layout with flex having the price and the "Add"
*       button in same line but in opposite sides
 *   4. Improve the styles of the app:
 *      - Give a background colour to the header.
 *      - Give margins to the header buttons.
 *      - Give a background colour to the main content.
 *      - Give padding to the main content.
 *      - Give a background colour to the articles.
 *      - Give margins to the article inner parts.
 *      - Give padding and a rounded border to the header and article buttons.
 *   5. Avoid the layout changes while the images are loading.
